                    <p>My motto is: I’m an artist who loves technology - making visual experiences look beautiful and feel engaging while serving a purpose.

                        Over the past sixteen years, I’ve worked alongside global teams to equip them to perform in their jobs, increase sales and achieve company-wide goals and initiatives. I’ve spent most of my career improving the design and delivery of online training and digital marketing materials. Thus far, the highlight of my career has been improving upon the UI/UX for an asset management platform. Through this experience our team was able to deliver a custom branded product to our clients, looking for a platform that met their functional needs while also creating brand recognition with their end clients.
